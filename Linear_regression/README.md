linearRegression : linear regression of a data set
%   [a,r2] = linreg(x,y): the sum of the squares of the residuals around
%   the mean of the data set
% input:
%     x = independent variable
%     y = dependent variable
% output:
%     a = vector of slope, a(1), and intercept, a(2)
%     r2 = coeffiecient of determination
