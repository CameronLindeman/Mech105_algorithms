luDecomp is a function that takes the coeffiecents of a n x n matrix and gives the user a lower and upper triangular matrix along with the permutation matrix. This code is created by Cameron Lindeman for Mechanical engineering 105 with Dr. Bechara.
* Inputs:
  * A- A is an n x n matrix that holds the coeffiecients of the systems of equations
  
* Outputs:
  * L-  is the lower triangular matrix
  * U-  is the upper triangular matrix
  * P-  is the permutation of the systems of equations done by the code
