Simpsons is a function that calculates the integral of a function that is
%not continuous and can not be calculated with calculus integrals.
%   Inputs:
%   x- is an array of data points that need to be equally spaced apart
%   y- is an array of data points that is the answer for the the b array
%   data points
%   Outputs:
%   I - the integral of the data points that are provided in a function.
if length(x)~=length(y)%checking to see if the lengths of the arrays are 
the sa$
    error('both arrays need to be the same length')
